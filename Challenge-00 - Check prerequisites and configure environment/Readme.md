# Challenge-00 - Welcome!

## Introduction 
In this preliminary challenge, you will be checking your Azure Subscription and other pieces of your environment to make sure that all prerequisites are met before starting Challenge-01.

## Background 
The Azure Health Data Services Workshop presents a series of challenges to help learners build skills in deploying and configuring [FHIR service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview), [FHIR-Proxy](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-proxy), and supporting tools. After completing the workshop challenges, learners will be ready to start building the system architectures featured on __[Microsoft Health Architectures](https://microsoft.github.io/health-architectures/)__.
 
## Learning Objectives for Challenge-00
+ Understand the general learner goals of this workshop
+ Understand the prerequisites for Challenge-01
+ Check environment to make sure that all prerequisites are met

## What do we want learners to gain from the Azure Health Data Services Workshop?
In general, we want learners to walk away with a sense of confidence in deploying, configuring, and applying Microsoft health data solutions.

+ In completing this workshop, learners will know how to **ingest**, **transform**, and **connect health data** using the Azure health data platform.

+ The tasks require learners to locate information in technical documentation and **resolve issues independently**.

+ Working on the challenges will give learners a strong concept of how the components fit together. With this knowledge, learners will be ready to **deploy Microsoft Health & Life Sciences (HLS) tools in real-world production environments**.  

## Prerequisite Knowledge for the Azure Health Data Services Workshop

+ A solid foundation in **Azure fundamentals**. If you are new to Microsoft Azure, please visit [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) to learn more about the platform.

+ Familiarity with the **FHIR R4 data standard** and general health data interoperability. Please visit [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/) for more information about the FHIR R4 specification.

+ Experience with making **REST API calls** using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-testing/) or a similar API testing utility.

## Environment Prerequisites
Please make sure you have the following before proceeding to Challenge-01.
